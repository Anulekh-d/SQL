1) DQ DRAWBACKS AND WHICH DAX AND TRANSFORMATION DOES NOT WORK 

DirectQuery, and limitations related to performance, security, transformations, modeling, and reporting.
Apparent Slowness in the Query response.
Gateway needs to be constantly running.
v/ NO DAX support
No data model formatting in the Data tab
No multiple data sources support
No Power Q&A support
Automatic date/time hierarchy is unavailable in DirectQuery.

2) LIVE CONNECTION 
A semantic model that already exists in Power BI service

An Azure Analysis Services (AAS) database

An on-premises instance of SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)

3) Which DAX function Cannot be used in direct query mode?
Not all functions can be used; the DAX PATH function cannot be used in DirectQuery models.

Direct query
Direct Query is a connection mainly Limited
data source like, SQL, Oracle, Snowflakes
In Direct Query there are limited Power Query
functionality available.
t Query mode usually is slower than Live
														Live connections
														Live Connections is a connection to sources:
														SSAS tabular, SSAS multi-dimensional, Azure
														Analysis Services, and Power Bl dataset.
														Live Connection has no Power Query features
														in it.
														A live connection is faster
														
														
														
DAX limitations: DAX time intelligence functions such as every year, month over month, and same period, are not supported when working with DirectQuery there are few transformations that do not work in direct query 

these are some common issues in live connection type. there are limited live sources which support live connection
A semantic model that already exists in Power BI service

An Azure Analysis Services (AAS) database

An on-premises instance of SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)



Modeling Dax userelation function
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Sales'[SalesAmount]),
    USERELATION('Sales'[CustomerID], 'Customers'[CustomerID])
